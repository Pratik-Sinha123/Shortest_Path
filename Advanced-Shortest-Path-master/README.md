# Shortest-Path
This is the repository for Shortest-Path Project.

This is part of the Advanced Shortest Path Project by Coursera's course on Graph algorithms.


Useofdijkstra-> uses bidirectional dijkstra to process queries


Coordinates->uses A-star Algorithm with eucledian distance as virtual function to process  queries


Procesing large dis and Processing small dis -> uses various Node Contraction Techniques for preprocessing and Bidirectional Dijkstra for query.
